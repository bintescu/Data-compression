# Data-compression
Compressing a text file using C++ and Java.

I made a C++(CodeBlocks) application that receives the first 3000 most common words in English and for a given text file calculates the probability of occurrence relative to the total number of words in the text file and calculate the Shannon Entropy.
In Java(InteliJJi IDEA), I made a Huffman tree that will create the binary code for each word and make another file with this binary code encryption and calculates for comparison the Average Information.
