In To Engineer is Human, an erudite exposition of engineering failures, Henry Petroski explores the reasons designs and structures fail. He incorporates examples of everyday objects and basic designs as well as large complex design failures. He cites several literary passages in the book that illuminate or obfuscate human failure and help illustrate his ideas. Each case study reinforces his underlying theme: engineering is more than precise science it is also human judgment, and humans have a proclivity for error. If we identify and analyze the mistakes, we can learn from them and improve our results.

As Petroski examines the nuances of engineering, he illustrates several ways that we make decisions often for aesthetics, simplicity or comfort that ultimately compromise our enjoyment and quality of life or even cause death. Always, failure is a learning opportunity and the means for making progress. He describes engineering as an art, a working hypothesis that evolves as we continuously reevaluate mistakes. I used to study architecture, so I am a little partial to the paradigm, but I cannot think of a better way to analyze decisions in business and life.

Some formulas for success work under some conditions and not under others. Distinguishing weaknesses between theories to find the best one can be difficult. Using some of Petroskiâ€™s Engineering examples from the book, I have outlined how to define your problem before taking action and two ways to identify a solution that may fail.
