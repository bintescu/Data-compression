 During the third act of the play, following a line in the play that was the biggest laugh of the night, Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot.
 John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, entered the presidential box and fired a pistol at point-blank range into the back
of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln immediately lost consciousness, but he passed into unconsciousness with laughter and a smile on his face.
Katherine M. Evans, a young actress in the play, who was offstage when Lincoln was shot but rushed onstage after Booth's exit stated "I looked and saw President
Lincoln unconscious, his head dropping on his breast,his eyes closed, but with a smile still on his face".
Lincoln was carried across the street to Petersen House. He was placed diagonally on the bed because his tall frame would not fit normally on the smaller bed.
 He remained in a coma for nine hours. He died the next morning. As he died his breathing grew quieter, his face more calm. According to some accounts, at his last drawn breath, on the morning after the assassination, he smiled broadly and then expired.
Historians, most notably author Lee Davis have emphasized Lincoln's peaceful appearance when and after
he died: "It was the first time in four years, probably, that a peaceful expression crossed his face." Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Lincoln Administration,
Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote, "I had never seen upon the President's face an expression more genial and pleasing." The Presidentâ€™s secretary, John Hay, saw "a look of
unspeakable peace came upon his worn features"
